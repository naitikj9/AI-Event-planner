Extract a structured event brief from the user's request.

Rules:
- Set in_scope=false ONLY if the request is not about planning an event, is
  nonsensical, or asks for something unsafe/illegal. Then give a short
  refusal_reason and leave other fields at defaults.
- Otherwise set in_scope=true and fill every field you can infer.
- budget_inr must be a plain integer in Indian Rupees. Convert shorthand:
  "8 lakh" -> 800000, "1.5 lakh" -> 150000, "50k" -> 50000.
- guest_count is an integer.
- Infer event_type from context (wedding, corporate, birthday, anniversary,
  conference, party, other).
- If the user mentions outdoor/garden/rooftop -> setting_preference="outdoor";
  hall/indoor/AC -> "indoor"; otherwise "any".
- Keep event_date exactly as the user expressed it (ISO if given)."""
